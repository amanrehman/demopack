{ "packaging" : [ {"title":"so seems like this particular piece has 30% less capacity than the ...","review":"Bought this product from Cloudtail India during one of the Amazon sales.What comes in the box:10400mAh Powerbank, Charging cable, instruction manual.Charging:I have an phone with a battery capacity of approx 3000 mAh and the power bank gives me about 2-2.5 charges... so seems like this particular piece has 30% less capacity than the 10400 mAh.Size & Weight:I have to say that this product is larger than i thought it would be when i bought it. It is about 5.5 inches long - which is about the size of a pen, 2 inches tall and 1 inch high.This being said, it is pretty light and can easily be carried around in your bag but probably would not fit in your pocket.Overall, i think that for many people a battery pack with a single charge might be easier to carry around and do the trick of getting your phone through the entire day... but if you are constantly on the move or need the exrta capacity, this would be a great bet.","rating":"4.0","score":3,"comparative":0.01639344262295082,"effective":0.06557377049180328,"wordLength":5},{"title":"Lenovo Power Bank - Not getting charged !
